# Installing MCP Gateway via OLM

This guide covers installing the MCP Gateway controller using [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/).

## Prerequisites

OpenShift clusters include OLM by default. For non-OpenShift Kubernetes clusters, install OLM first:

```bash
make olm-install
```

## Install

Deploy from a release tag using kustomize with a remote ref:

```bash
export MCP_GATEWAY_VERSION=0.6.0-rc2
kubectl apply -k "https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/config/deploy/olm?ref=v${MCP_GATEWAY_VERSION}"
```

Wait for the controller to be ready. The CSV may take a moment to appear while OLM processes the subscription:

```bash
kubectl wait csv -n mcp-system -l operators.coreos.com/mcp-gateway.mcp-system="" \
  --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Succeeded --timeout=5m
```

If the command returns "no matching resources found", wait a few seconds and retry -- the CSV has not been created yet.

## Next Steps

Installing via OLM deploys the operator only. To deploy the MCP Gateway itself, create an `MCPGatewayExtension` resource. See [Manual Resource Creation](./isolated-gateway-deployment.md#manual-resource-creation) for details.

## Uninstall

```bash
make undeploy-olm
```

## Local Development (Kind)

The default `local-env-setup` target uses kustomize:

```bash
make local-env-setup
```

To use the OLM-based deployment instead (installs both MCP Gateway and Kuadrant via OLM):

```bash
make local-env-setup-olm
```

This builds the bundle and catalog images locally, loads them into the Kind cluster, deploys the Kuadrant OLM catalog, and lets OLM resolve Kuadrant as a dependency automatically.

> **Note:**
> When using `make local-env-setup-olm`, Kuadrant is installed in the same namespace as MCP Gateway (e.g. `mcp-system`), rather than the default `kuadrant-system` namespace used by the Helm-based installation.  
> This may be relevant when inspecting resources or debugging installation issues.
