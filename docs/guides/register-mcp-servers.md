# MCP Server Registration

You must register your MCP servers to be discovered and routed by the MCP Gateway. When a server is registered, the gateway automatically discovers and federates its capabilities (tools and prompts), applying a prefix to avoid name collisions across multiple servers.

## Overview

MCP Gateway supports federating both MCP Tools and MCP Prompts.

- **Discovery**: The gateway's broker automatically discovers available tools and prompts from registered upstream servers.
- **Prefixing**: To prevent collisions between capabilities with the same name on different servers, the gateway applies the `prefix` defined in the `MCPServerRegistration` to each tool and prompt name (e.g., `greet` becomes `myserver_greet`).
- **Routing**: When a client calls a tool or requests a prompt, the gateway identifies the target upstream server by the prefix, strips the prefix, and routes the request to the correct server.

To connect an MCP server to MCP Gateway, you must create an `HTTPRoute` that routes to your MCP server and an `MCPServerRegistration` resource that references the `HTTPRoute`.

## Prerequisites

- You installed and configured the MCP Gateway
- Your Gateway has both the `mcp` and `mcps` listeners configured (see [Configure MCP Gateway Listener and Route](./configure-mcp-gateway-listener-and-router.md))
- An MCP server is running in your cluster

## Procedure

## Step 1: Ensure MCPGatewayExtension exists

An MCPGatewayExtension tells the controller which Gateway this MCP Gateway instance serves. Without it, MCPServerRegistration resources will remain in NotReady status.

> **Note:** Only one MCPGatewayExtension is allowed per namespace. The `sectionName` field selects which listener on the Gateway to use, but each namespace can only have one MCPGatewayExtension. If you followed the [quick start](./quick-start.md) or [install guide](./how-to-install-and-configure.md), an MCPGatewayExtension already exists. Check with `kubectl get mcpgatewayextension -A`. If one is already present and Ready, skip to Step 2.

If you need to create one:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: mcp.kuadrant.io/v1
kind: MCPGatewayExtension
metadata:
  name: mcp-extension
  namespace: mcp-test
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: mcp-gateway
    namespace: gateway-system
    sectionName: mcp  # must match a listener name on the Gateway
EOF
```

If your MCPGatewayExtension is in a different namespace than the Gateway, create a ReferenceGrant first:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: allow-mcp-extension
  namespace: gateway-system  # Gateway's namespace
spec:
  from:
    - group: mcp.kuadrant.io
      kind: MCPGatewayExtension
      namespace: mcp-test  # MCPGatewayExtension's namespace
  to:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
EOF
```

Wait for it to become ready:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready mcpgatewayextension/mcp-extension -n mcp-test --timeout=60s
```

## Step 2: Create an HTTPRoute

Create an `HTTPRoute` that routes to your MCP server. The hostname must match the wildcard on the `mcps` listener of your Gateway (e.g. `*.mcp.local`). This is an internal-only hostname used for routing through the gateway and does not need to be publicly resolvable.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: my-mcp-server-route
  namespace: mcp-test
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: mcp-gateway
      namespace: gateway-system
      sectionName: mcps
  hostnames:
    - 'my-mcp-server.mcp.local'  # must match the mcps listener wildcard
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: mcp-test-server1    # Your MCP server service name
          port: 9090                # Your MCP server port
EOF
```

## Step 3: Create MCPServerRegistration Resource

Create an `MCPServerRegistration` resource that references the HTTPRoute:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: mcp.kuadrant.io/v1
kind: MCPServerRegistration
metadata:
  name: my-mcp-server
  namespace: mcp-test
spec:
  prefix: "myserver_"
  targetRef:
    group: "gateway.networking.k8s.io"
    kind: "HTTPRoute"
    name: "my-mcp-server-route"  # Must match the HTTPRoute name
    namespace: "mcp-test"
EOF
```

## Step 4: Verify Registration

Wait for the MCPServerRegistration to become ready (Ready means the config has been written to the gateway config secret; the broker discovers tools asynchronously after that):

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready mcpsr/my-mcp-server -n mcp-test --timeout=120s
```

Then check the status:

```bash
kubectl get mcpsr -A
```

The `READY` column should show `True`. For example:

```text
NAMESPACE   NAME            PREFIX      TARGET               PATH   READY   CATEGORY   CREDENTIALS   AGE
mcp-test    my-mcp-server   myserver_   my-mcp-server-route   /mcp   True                             30s
```

To check tool availability, query the broker's `/status` endpoint.

If the status is not Ready, check the MCPServerRegistration conditions for details:

```bash
kubectl describe mcpsr my-mcp-server -n mcp-test
```

## Step 5: Test Tool Discovery

Verify that your MCP server tools are available through the gateway by using the following commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize MCP session and capture session ID
# Use -D to dump headers to a file, then read the session ID
curl -s -D /tmp/mcp_headers -X POST http://mcp.127-0-0-1.sslip.io:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2025-11-25", "capabilities": {}, "clientInfo": {"name": "test-client", "version": "1.0.0"}}}'

# Extract the MCP session ID from response headers
SESSION_ID=$(grep -i "mcp-session-id:" /tmp/mcp_headers | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r')

echo "MCP Session ID: $SESSION_ID"

# Step 2: List tools using the session ID
curl -X POST http://mcp.127-0-0-1.sslip.io:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list"}'
```

You should now see your MCP server tools in the response, prefixed with your configured `prefix` (e.g., `myserver_`).

## Step 6: Test Prompt Discovery

Verify that your MCP server prompts are also available through the gateway:

```bash
# Use the same SESSION_ID from the previous step
curl -X POST http://mcp.127-0-0-1.sslip.io:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "prompts/list"}'
```

You should see your MCP server prompts in the response, also prefixed with your configured `prefix`.

## Step 7: Getting a Prompt

To retrieve a specific prompt, use the `prompts/get` method with the federated (prefixed) name:

```bash
curl -X POST http://mcp.127-0-0-1.sslip.io:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 4,
    "method": "prompts/get",
    "params": {
      "name": "myserver_gh_pr_review",
      "arguments": {
        "pr_number": "42"
      }
    }
  }'

# Clean up
rm -f /tmp/mcp_headers
```

You should now see your MCP server tools and prompts in the response, prefixed with your configured `prefix` (e.g., `myserver_`).

## Disabling a Server

You can temporarily disable a registered server without deleting it. Setting `state: Disabled` disconnects the broker from the upstream server and removes its tools and prompts from the gateway.

```bash
kubectl patch mcpsr my-mcp-server -n mcp-test --type merge -p '{"spec":{"state":"Disabled"}}'
```

The status condition will show `Ready: False` with reason `Disabled`. To re-enable:

```bash
kubectl patch mcpsr my-mcp-server -n mcp-test --type merge -p '{"spec":{"state":"Enabled"}}'
```

The broker reconnects and restores the server's tools and prompts. No other resources need to be recreated.

## Next Steps

After you have MCP servers registered, you can explore advanced features:

- Create focused tool collections with **[Virtual MCP Servers](./virtual-mcp-servers.md)**
- Configure OAuth-based security with **[Authentication](./authentication.md)**
- Set up fine-grained access control with **[Authorization](./authorization.md)**
