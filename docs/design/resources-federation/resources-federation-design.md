# Feature: MCP Resources Federation

## Summary

Add partial support for federating MCP Resources through the gateway. The broker aggregates resource lists from all connected upstreams at request time, rewrites `ui://` URIs with a per-server prefix to avoid collisions, and merges the results. The router dispatches `resources/read` to the correct upstream by parsing the prefix from the URI. A response-path step handles `_meta.ui.resourceUri` fields in `tools/call` responses so the URI the client gets from a tool result stays consistent with what `resources/list` returns. Ref: [#788](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/788), split from [#208](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/208).

## Goals

- Federate `resources/list` and `resources/read` from multiple upstream servers through a single gateway endpoint
- Rewrite `ui://` URIs using the server's existing `prefix` to avoid cross-upstream collisions
- Route `resources/read` to the correct upstream by parsing the prefixed URI
- Rewrite `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in `tools/call` responses to match the prefixed form

## Non-Goals

- Non `ui://` URI schemes - tracked in [#1238](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/1238)
- Resource subscriptions - the 2026-07-28 spec update (SEP-2567) removes protocol sessions and restricts server-to-client requests, fundamentally changing the delivery model. Scope narrowed per [guidance on #788](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/788#issuecomment-4682923399); tracked separately as #597 (closed)
- URI templates (`resources/templates/list`)
- Stateless (Streamable HTTP) protocol support
- VirtualServer filtering for resources
- `cacheScope` / `ttlMs` cache-aware proxying (SEP-2549, future consideration - see [scoping discussion on #788](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/788#issuecomment-4682923399))
- Pagination - `resources/list` supports cursor-based pagination in the spec; aggregating cursors across multiple upstreams is a non-trivial problem deferred to a follow-up

## Design

### Backwards Compatibility

No breaking changes. No CRD fields are added or renamed, no existing headers are modified, and no existing methods change signature. The `resources` key in the `x-mcp-authorized` JWT was already reserved as part of the prompts federation design. `resources/list` and `resources/read` are not handled today, so there is nothing to break.

### URI Prefixing

The gateway injects the server's existing `prefix` into the authority segment of the `ui://` URI:

```
ui://template.html  →  ui://{prefix}template.html
```

For example, with prefix `insights_`:
```
ui://template.html  →  ui://insights_template.html
```

The router extracts the prefix back out by matching the authority against registered server prefixes.

**Servers without a prefix cannot participate in resource federation.** Without a prefix, the gateway has no way to distinguish a resource's origin and cannot route `resources/read` correctly. This is enforced at list time - resources from a no-prefix server are excluded from the `resources/list` result.

**Conflict detection**: Because resource URIs are namespaced by prefix, collisions can only occur if two servers share the same prefix, which is already rejected at the MCPServerRegistration level. No additional conflict detection pass is needed for resources.

**Prefix safety for URI injection**: the CRD's existing `+kubebuilder:validation:Pattern=^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_]*$` on `prefix` already excludes `/`, `?`, and `#`, so today's tool-naming validation happens to be URI-authority-safe. That's coincidental rather than designed-in; the pattern exists to prevent tool-name collisions, not to guarantee URI safety, and tools/prompts only ever use the prefix in plain string concatenation. As defense-in-depth, `GetServerInfoByResource` and the URI-rewrite path explicitly re-check for `/`, `?`, and `#` at the point the prefix is injected into the `ui://` authority, independent of the CRD validation. A server whose prefix fails this check is excluded from resource federation, same as a server with no prefix at all. This guards against a future loosening of the CRD pattern for tool-naming reasons silently opening a URI-injection path for resources. Flagging this for maintainer confirmation! Open to doing this purely at the CRD level instead if that's preferred.

### Architecture

No new components. The existing broker, upstream connections, and router are extended.

Unlike tools and prompts, resources will not be pre-registered into mcp-go. An upstream can expose a large number of resources and pre-registering them would duplicate upstream state with no benefit. The `AddAfterListResources` hook fetches from each upstream at request time instead.

### Component Changes

| Component | File | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Upstream client | `internal/broker/upstream/mcp.go` | Add `SupportsResources()` and `ListResources()` to the `MCP` interface |
| Upstream connection | `internal/broker/upstream/manager.go` | Add `ListResources()` for pull-time fetching; no pre-registration |
| Broker | `internal/broker/broker.go` | Enable resource capabilities, gated on at least one upstream supporting resources, following the same pattern as prompts; register `AddAfterListResources` hook; add `GetServerInfoByResource()` to `MCPBroker` interface |
| Router request | `internal/mcp-router/request_handlers.go` | Add `HandleResourceRead()`; add `resources/read` case in `RouteMCPRequest`; add `ResourceURI()` to `MCPRequest` |
| Router response | `internal/mcp-router/server.go`, new `internal/mcp-router/resource_rewrite.go` | Construct `resourceURIRewriter` in the `ResponseHeaders` case (mirroring how `sseRewriter` is wired today); detect and rewrite `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in `tools/call` response bodies |
| Config / CRD | `internal/config/types.go`, `api/v1alpha1/types.go` | No changes (VirtualServer filtering out of scope) |

`GetServerInfoByResource(uri string)` parses the authority segment of the URI and does longest-prefix matching against registered server prefixes - the same approach `GetServerInfo` already uses for tools.

The `AddAfterListResources` hook calls `ListResources()` on each active upstream with a per-upstream timeout (same default as the broker's existing upstream timeout), rewrites the `ui://` URIs, and merges results. Upstreams that error or time out are skipped with a log - the request is not failed. Upstreams with no prefix are skipped entirely.

`notifications/resources/list_changed` from upstreams requires no handler. Because resources are fetched at request time, no callback registration is needed - unlike tools and prompts which pre-register and must react to upstream changes.

`_meta.ui.resourceUri` is a gateway convention introduced by MCP Apps (SEP-1865, referenced in [#788](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/788)). It is not part of the core MCP spec.

### Response Rewrite Implementation

The `_meta.ui.resourceUri` rewrite needs the originating server's prefix at response time, inside `internal/mcp-router/server.go`'s `Process()` loop. That loop already carries `mcpRequest` as a closure-scoped variable across the `RequestBody` → `ResponseHeaders` → `ResponseBody` phases of a single ext_proc stream, and `mcpRequest.serverName` is already populated during the request phase (the same lookup `HandleToolCall` uses today). No new per-request store is needed to make the prefix available at response time.

The existing `sseRewriter` (`internal/mcp-router/elicitation.go`), used today for rewriting elicitation request IDs, is the closest precedent for the Process/Flush lifecycle, but isn't a good fit to extend directly:

- It's only constructed when `clientElicitation && statusCode == "200"` - resource-URI rewriting needs to run on any tool call response, not just sessions that registered for elicitation.
- It assumes SSE framing (splits on `\n`, only rewrites `data:`-prefixed lines). A typical non-streaming `tools/call` JSON response has neither, so reusing it as-is would silently fail to rewrite plain JSON bodies.

Proposed instead: a new sibling rewriter (`resourceURIRewriter`), constructed in the `ResponseHeaders` case gated on `mcpRequest.isToolCall()` alone, following the same Process/Flush pattern but handling both plain single-JSON bodies and SSE-framed bodies (tool responses can be either, depending on the upstream's transport). It runs independently of the elicitation rewriter - composed, not merged into one struct, for responses that need both. Open to feedback on whether this should instead be a single generalized body-rewriter interface with multiple implementations if that's a better fit for how the router evolves.

### Authorization

The `x-mcp-authorized` JWT already reserves a `resources` key in the `allowed-capabilities` claim, defined as part of the prompts federation design:

```json
{
  "tools": { "insights-server": ["get_forecast"] },
  "prompts": { "insights-server": ["weather_summary"] },
  "resources": { "insights-server": ["ui://insights_template.html"] }
}
```

A new `filtered_resources_handler.go` mirrors `filtered_prompts_handler.go`. Unlike tools and prompts where filtering runs on a pre-populated set, resource filtering runs **per-upstream within the `AddAfterListResources` hook, before results are merged**. This means the filter is applied to each upstream's resource list individually before they are combined into the response - consistent with the per-server structure of the `resources` claim in the JWT.

Enforcement semantics are unchanged: a missing `resources` key makes no assertion about resources (behavior governed by `enforceCapabilityFilter`). An empty map (`"resources": {}`) explicitly denies all resources.

### Security Considerations

- Prefix values are re-checked against `/`, `?`, and `#` at the point they're injected into a `ui://` authority segment, independent of the CRD's `prefix` pattern validation - defense-in-depth in case that pattern is loosened later for tool-naming reasons alone. See "Prefix safety for URI injection" above.
- URI prefix matching is done against the server's registered prefix, not free-form input from the client. An unrecognized prefix in `resources/read` returns a routing error, same as an unknown tool name.
- The `_meta.ui.resourceUri` rewrite only applies to `ui://` URIs. A non `ui://` value or malformed URI in `_meta` is left untouched.
- `resources/read` routing uses the same client auth flow as `tools/call` - the client's Authorization header flows through to the upstream. `credentialRef` on MCPServerRegistration is only for broker-to-upstream connections, not client-facing auth.
- No new privilege escalation surface. Resources are a distinct capability from tools and prompts in the JWT claim - authorization for tools on a server does not grant access to its resources.

### Open Questions

1. **Partial list on upstream failure**: If one upstream times out during `AddAfterListResources`, the gateway returns a partial resource list. Is this acceptable, or should the hook fail the whole request?

### Future Considerations

- **Stateless / session-less spec evolution**: SEP-2575 would remove the `initialize`/`initialized` handshake outright, and SEP-2567 removes protocol sessions. This design deliberately does not build against either - both are unreleased, and per [maintainer guidance on #788](https://github.com/Kuadrant/mcp-gateway/issues/788#issuecomment-4682923399) scope stays narrowed to the current, stateful spec. The one coupling point worth flagging for whoever picks this up later: `ListResources()` is proposed to go through the same upstream connection/session abstraction in `internal/broker/upstream/manager.go` that `ListTools`/`ListPrompts` already use, rather than a resources-specific connection path - so if/when the handshake model changes, that's a single shared migration instead of three divergent ones. This isn't specific to resource federation either - it would affect the broker's existing tool/prompt capability advertisement just as much, so any future redesign belongs at that shared layer, not here. Raising this now so maintainers can confirm the scope boundary is right rather than discovering it later.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: `ListResources()` per upstream; URI rewriting (prefix injection and stripping for `ui://`); `GetServerInfoByResource()` prefix matching; `HandleResourceRead()` body rewriting; `AddAfterListResources` hook merging; `_meta.ui.resourceUri` rewrite in the response handler; resource filtering via `x-mcp-authorized`. Mirror the tool and prompt test patterns in `manager_test.go`, `broker_test.go`, `request_handlers_test.go`.
- **E2E tests**: Register a server with `ui://` resources, verify `resources/list` returns prefixed URIs, call `resources/read` and verify contents are returned, verify `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in a tool response is prefixed. Test with multiple servers to confirm prefix isolation. Add a `ui://` resource to the existing `server1` test server (which already exposes an `embedded:info` resource) rather than standing up a dedicated test server.
